# 🌱 My First Portfolio Website

Welcome to my **first personal portfolio website**!  
This project marks the beginning of my web development journey. It’s a simple layout built using **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**, created to practice the basics of front-end development and design.

## 🧠 About the Project
This portfolio was my very first step into web development.  
At the time, I didn’t have any projects to showcase — so I focused on building a clean, simple, and responsive layout to introduce myself and my learning goals.

The website includes basic sections like:
- **Home** – Introduction and welcome message  
- **About** – A short summary about me and my interests  
- **Skills** – The technologies I started learning (HTML, CSS, JS)  
- **Contact** – Simple contact form and social links
